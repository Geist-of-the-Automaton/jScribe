# jScribe
A word processor with convenient functions and clean UI. 

I worked on this project, on and off (because of classes and work), for about 6 months. I started it during the fall semester of my sophomore year for fun (also for experience and to learn, but mainly for fun). I used Java as it was the language I knew the most at the time and it's conveinently built-in GUI libraries made the visual aspect of the project a breeze.

If you have any questions please email me at GeistfulAutomaton@gmail.com.
I provided the JAR only to protect my creation as my source is really extensive; I will release the source when I am out of college and safely into my career. If you are a potential employer looking to see my source for this project please contact me at the email above.

I plan to move onto graphical development in C and C++ with a 2D games first and then with a renderer later (via rasterization, although I ideally want to work on ray tracing or ray marching). I would eventually like to learn more python and make a NEAT AI implementation accomplishing something.
