# jScribe
A word processor with solid functions and features paired with a clean UI.

Available functions: multi-paging, select text over multiple pages, multi-tabbed documents, recent docs, print, undo, redo, copy, cut, paste, change case (upper, lower, reverse, cap every word), word count (including page count and character count), find and replace, dictionary, and a setting menu to change some of the aforementioned feature functionality.

I worked on this project, on and off (because of classes and work), for about 6 months. I started it during the fall semester of my sophomore year for fun (also for experience and to learn, but mainly for fun). I used Java as it was the language I knew the most at the time and it's conveinently built-in GUI libraries made the visual aspect of the project a breeze. I specifically used Swing.

If you are a potential employer looking to see my source for this project please contact me at the email above. I provided the JAR only to protect my creation as my source is really extensive (~4000 lines); I will release the source when I am out of college and safely into my career.
