# jScribe
A word processor with convenient functions and clean UI. 

I worked on this project, on and off (because of classes and work), for about 6 months. I started it during the fall semester of my sophomore year for fun (also for experience and to learn, but mainly for fun). I used Java as it was the language I knew the most at the time and it's conveinently built-in GUI libraries made the visual aspect of the project a breeze.

If you have any questions please email me at GeistfulAutomaton@gmail.com.
I provided the JAR only to protect my creation as my source is really extensive(~4000 lines); I will release the source when I am out of college and safely into my career. If you are a potential employer looking to see my source for this project please contact me at the email above.
